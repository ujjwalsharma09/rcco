<p>Happy Birthday baby. I hope you doing good. First of all, I miss you so much and couldn't get this thought out of my mind that we are not together on this special day.  But we gonna party hard as soon as this corona thing settles. I promise I will always try my best to make your each day as special as you are to me, and I promise to make your year even more special! Sending countless kisses and hugs to decorate your Birthday with my love.</p>

<p>I always brag about you to my friends as i am extremely proud to have you in my life. When a challenge comes on my way, I tend to fall in it. Instead I remember your half smile and I press on with it. You smile embers love deep down in my heart.</p>

<p>I want to share my success, my failures, my sorrow, my happiness, my affection, my traumas, my soul and everything with you. I hope our bond remains this special forever and beyond.</p>
